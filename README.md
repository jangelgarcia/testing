# Java and jUnit tests

## Setup
To start working you must first checkout **develop** branch from this repository. You can either do that via console or using eclipse. Afterwards, import the Java project to an eclipse workspace.

## Project overview
Our Java project contains the following classes:
- Product. This class represents a product, which has a unique id, a name, a price and a stock.
- Basket. A basket is an object which can contain products. You can add products to a **Basket** and carry out a checkout process.
- ProductItem. This is a structure which consists of two elements: a **Product** and a quantity.

## What you need to do
Your goal is to think about what kind of tests would need to implement in order to test our class **Basket**. Then, you will see our solution proposal implemented by means of jUnit and you will have to tell us what do you think about it.
